# ngram-language-model-lab

Lab for CS6983/CS4973 Research in Human-Centered NLP .

You can run these notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hyesunyun/ngram-language-model-lab/blob/main/n_gram_word_prediction.ipynb). 
You won't need to create a virtual environment for Google Colab as it comes with all the packages we need installed.

You can also run them locally:
```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hyesunyun/ngram-language-model-lab.git
cd ngram-language-model-lab

# create a virtual environment (conda)
conda create -n ngram python=3.10
conda activate ngram

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the server
jupyter notebook
```
