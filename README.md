# ngram-language-model-lab

Lab for CS6983/CS4973 Research in Human-Centered NLP.

You can run these notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hyesunyun/ngram-language-model-lab/blob/main/n_gram_word_prediction.ipynb). 
You won't need to create a virtual environment for Google Colab as it comes with all the packages we need installed. However, you will need to manually add the data (`en_US.twitter.txt` from data folder) to the files in Google Colab.

cd ngram-language-model-lab

# create a virtual environment (conda)
conda create -n ngram python=3.10
conda activate ngram

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the server
